The expected content files here were generated by running the kubernetes mode against a
Docker for Desktop cluster with the Kapacitor StatefulSet previously deployed using 
`dev/event-engine-kube/kapacitor.yml` from the bundle repo. 

To view/grab the actualy content a breakpoint was added at

https://github.com/kubernetes-client/java/blob/2e43cbe52c2379755653f18a29957f3896a6722e/util/src/main/java/io/kubernetes/client/util/Watch.java#L121

with logging of the `line` variable.

The `added.json` is observed at first startup and invocation of the watch.

The `modified-down.json` is observed when deleting one of the pods in the stateful set:

```
kubectl delete pod kapacitor-0
```

The `deleted.json` is observed when deleting the service, which in turn deletes the endpoints
resource:

```
kubectl delete svc kapacitor
```
